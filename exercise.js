// ğŸ’¡Note: you have to use first-class function concepts: call-back functions, higher-order functions
// ğŸ’¡Note: you need a calculator function
// ğŸ’¡Note: your calculator will return the result of the operation and numbers passed to it
// operation (add machine, divide machine) based on the passed function and numbers

//! IMPORTANT:
// you have to build separated functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
// and use them in your calculator

// TIP: i want the calculator to perform an add operation on two numbers means your calculator:
// should take: two numbers and one operation function as parameters

const cost = 11;
if (cost > 10) {
  var number = 10;
}
console.log(number);
