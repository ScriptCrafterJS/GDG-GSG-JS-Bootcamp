/* Assignment 1: User Profile ⚡

 -> Your task is to build a simple JavaScript program that creates and updates a user object.
 -> 💡Tip: Make sure to understand how the "this" keyword works in JavaScript — it's easy to grasp 😊
 -> You can check this reference: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp (or Google it if you don't trust URLs 🙄)

 1. Start by declaring a `user` object with the following properties: name, age, 
    hobbies (the user could have multiple hobbies), 
    and address (the address should contain: street, city and country) ❗Don’t combine the address into a single-line string.

 2. Create a method on the `user` object that allows adding a new hobby.
    - This method should accept one argument: the new hobby.
    - It should add this new hobby to the user hobbies.

 3. Make your `add hobby` method smart:
    - Think: when a user object is first created, does it already have any record of how many hobbies were added after creation?
    - What if you want to keep count of the number of times a hobby was added later on?
    - Can you figure out how to initialize that counter the first time it’s needed?
    - And what should happen the next time a hobby is added?
    🧠 Think it through — don’t overcomplicate it!

 4. Create a method on the `user` object that prints the full user info in this format:
    (e.g. "Name: John, Age: 30, Hobbies: [reading, swimming], Address: 123 Main St, New York, USA")
    - kindly use backticks to format the string 😊.
